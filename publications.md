### Causal de Finetti: On the Identification of Invariant Causal Structure in Exchangeable Data
**Siyuan Guo***, Viktor Tóth*, Bernhard Schölkopf, Ferenc Huszár (2021)
#### Abstract
Learning invariant causal structure often relies on conditional independence testing and assumption of independent and identically distributed data. Recent work has explored inferring invariant causal
structure using data coming from different environments. These approaches are based on independent causal mechanism (ICM) principle which postulates that the cause mechanism is independent of
the effect given cause mechanism. Despite its wide application in
machine learning and causal inference, there lacks a statistical formalization of what independent mechanism means. Here we present
Causal de Finetti which offers a first statistical formalization of ICM
principle.

### Teams Frightened of Failure Fail More: Modelling Reward Sensitivity in Teamwork. 
**Siyuan Guo**, Soo Ling Lim, Peter J. Bentley

Accepted at IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI 2020)
#### Abstract
According to Gray’s Reinforcement Sensitivity
Theory (RST), individuals have differing sensitivities to rewards
and punishments, which in turn affect their behaviours. The
behavioural inhibition system (BIS) is associated with sensitivity
to punishment while the behavioural activation system (BAS) is
associated with sensitivity to reward. In this work, we model
BIS/BAS by supplementing an existing agent-based model of team
collaboration in order to explore the combined effect on team
performance for a more complex and realistic personality
structure. We investigate the significance of BIS/BAS on team
behaviour for tasks with differing levels of uncertainty. Findings
include a prediction that for tasks with uncertainty, a majority of
personality types are significantly influenced by behavioural
activation system, and that all personality types are significantly
negatively influenced by behavioural inhibition system. The more
sensitive to punishments, the worse teams perform.
